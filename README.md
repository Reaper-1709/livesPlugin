# livesPlugin
The main idea is, when you join you only have 5 lives and if you die you loose a live and if you get to 0 you get banned.

There are mainly two recipes:

1. Life:
  crafted with 3 netherite ingots at top, a beacon at center and 5 redstone blocks in the remaining slots, when right-clicked gives the clicker an extra life.

2. Revive Item:
  crafted with a nether star at center, 3 obsidians at bottom and 5 diamonds in the remaining slots, when clicked opens a gui allowing you to revive a banned player.

more coming soon...
